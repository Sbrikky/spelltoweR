An attempt to make an app/script that calculates the potential of a Spelltower board

Things needed:
1. Way to create and input game boards:
  * OCR on a screenshot
  * Generate random boards
  * Type in a board
2. Handle moves:
  * Define the letters of a move
  * Calculate score of a move
  * Create board resulting from a move
3. Create algorithm to play a game (A complete set of moves)
  * Define algorithms to find possible moves
  * Define algorithms that find optimal way to determine moves to achieve highest score per board
4. Plotting
  * Visualize moves by showing before, selected word and after
  * Visualize algorithms by showing the words being considered
  * Visulize game by showing all steps with a score
5. Word lists
 * Word list with words that it's allowed to find
 * Check letters combinations against word list
